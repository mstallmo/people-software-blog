I'm pulling a little bit of an audible from what I said I was going to write about in my last blog post. Instead of talking about the video streaming platform I've been building for work I want to talk about Rust. No I'm not going to be talk about the oxidation process that iron goes through but Rust the programming language. 

This post is aimed at people who are new to Rust (since I'm pretty new myself). If you've heard of Rust before but haven't tried it yet I hope you find this insightful. If you've never heard of Rust before I hope that I can give enough background and generate enough interest that you want to start using it! Either way moar Rust!

## TLDR; ðŸ“–
I'm going to quote the TLDR from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), 
>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

That's it Rust in a nutshell, time to go home right! Ehh not quite, while this is true and a pretty effective TLDR I think it doesn't do the language a lot of justice. There is a lot more to Rust than just preventing segfaults and thread safety. Let's take a look at this a little deeper.

## Hot Takes ðŸ”¥
Mason's hot takes on using Rust incoming! I've been using it in my free time over the last month or so just out of pure curiosity. I kept hearing little rumblings around about Rust and it kept popping up in my feed so I decided to give it a shot and it's been a blast.

### Highlights
- Option types are ðŸ’¯!
- Traits >>> inheritance
- Zero cost abstractions all day
- Everything about the `match` keyword

### Option Types
Being fairly new to the industry out of college I had never heard of the concept of an [option type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type) before. For those unfamiliar like I was the option type is a concept from functional programming that represents a value that may or may-not be there. On the surface it may not sound like a huge difference between that and returning null but it completely changes how you program to handle the option. An added bonus is that Rust doesn't even contain the concept of Null so say goodbye to your friend the null pointer exception ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰. Once you write code in a language with this option type you won't want to go back. If you're interested in a more comprehensive explanation of the Option type check out this section in the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values)
