So I did exactly what I said I wasn't going to and didn't want to do in my first post; I put out a blog in September and then total radio silence. ...whoops :grimacing: .

With all that said I am back and do have a concrete plan for the next few posts. Over the next few weeks I'll be walking through and outlining building strongly typed web applications. I will be building this site with Rust and Rocket on the backend, ReasonML on the frontend and a little bit of WebAssembly thrown in there for good measure.

As to what I'll be building...you'll just have to stop back and see for yourself!
